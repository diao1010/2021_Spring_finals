## Overview & Background
Pit stops are one of the most tense and exciting features of formula one race. During F1 races, cars stop in pit stalls for maintenance and adjustments. In this project, we would like to find out how different strategies affect results in Formula One. 

## Data Source
All information on the Formula 1 races, drivers, constructors, qualifying, circuits, lap times, pit stops, championships from 1950 - 2020

## Hypothesis1
### Less pit stops gives the driver better rank in each race
The following boxplot shows race result of different amount of pit stop. As we can see, taking 1 pit stop usually gives the driver a position around 7, and it goes around 9, 11, 10, 9 when the pit stop gets more. For taking pitstops between 1 to 3, we can see that taking more stops usually brings driver a lower position. However, if we look at results for taking over 3 pit stops, there are no evidence supporting lower pitstops gives driver better position.<br>

The next three bar charts show the count of positions in history records when taking 1, 2 or 3 pit stops:

In these three bar charts, we can see there is not strong relationship between pit stop counts and positions.
<br> 
Since there is no relationship shown in the three bar charts, we still want to rule out other facts that may affect race positions such as circuits, and re-analysis. In the following table, we can see the count of positions in a given pit stop amount and circuit. These circuits that are chosen to hold f1 races every year during the past decade.

In this table, we can see that even we ruled out circuit, the bar charts still doesn't show taking less pit stops give driver a better rank. Therfore, there is no sufficient evidence to support hypothesis1.

## Hypothesis2
### Laps of the each pit stop times should be similar for better tire usage.
(1) 1 pit stop

From the plot above, we could see that if the team chooses only pit stop once in the total race, then they tend to pit during the half the race. 

(2) 2 pit stops

From the plot above, we could see that if the team chooses to pit stop twice in the total race, most of the teams will choose to pit during the 0.2~0.3 total race laps at the first time, which is pretty close to 1/3. Furthermore, the second time pit tends to be happened aroung 0.6 of total race laps, which is also very close to 2/3.

(3) 3 and 4 pit stops

If we see the plot 3 and 4 pit stops, they both have a peak in the beginning of the race. This might because in the beginning of the race, drivers will fight for the leading position and there might be some collisions between them. But since these data are already filtered as finished race. It means, even they have collision, they just need to pit and back to the race again. But we donâ€™t think we could say they have significant difference when they need to pit stop. 

We don't have strong evidence to reject the hypothesis 2 when the team pit stop times smaller than 3 times, since the plots show that most of the pit stop timing are average based on total pit times.
